# Introduction

The PKT token is built on the Base blockchain. This opens up a world of possibilities with best-in-class wallets, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), marketplaces, real-world assets (RWAs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Base also enhances PKT interoperability with other notable projects within the Optimism and broader Ethereum ecosystems. This compatibility extends PKTâ€™s reach and functionality, integrating it into a larger network of blockchain applications and services. Such connectivity fosters potential collaborations and innovations across different platforms and industries and helps drive utility for PKT token holders.
