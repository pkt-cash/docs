    * Click __"Add Stake +"__.
    * Choose a name for the Stake, such as `<yourdomain>.pkt`.

    * Click __"Register"__ and confirm the transaction on the Base blockchain.
    * If the __"Minimum Stake Value"__ has increased between the time which you created the Stake and claim the domain, you must return to the Stake tab and click the 3 dots to the right of the Stake and select __"Add assets"__. Top up the Stake as required, and click __"Next"__ to confirm the transaction on the Base blockchain.

6. Once confirmed, you now have registered your free domain for life. You will retain custody of your domain as long as you maintain your stake.
7. To park a website on your domain:

    * Click __"Manage"__ next to the domain name.
    * Click __"Add Record +"__
    * Enter in the details for your hosting provider and if you are using subdomains.
    * Click __"Save Changes"__.

!!! note "Additional Information" 
    The minimum Stake amount required to register a domain ranges between 1,000 PKT and 50,000 PKT. The minimum Stake amount doubles every time someone registers, until it reaches 34,000, at which point it begins growing by half the distance to 50,000. In this way it's an asymptotic curve trending toward the max. Every hour it decreases by 1/2 the distance between it's current value and the minimum.
