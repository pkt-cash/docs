    install `pktwallet` and other utilities by clicking
    on the appropriate package icon or running an installation command

## Creating a New Wallet

To create a new PKT wallet, use the pld --create command:

    ./bin/pld --create

You will be prompted to follow a few steps. Make sure you write your seed words on paper so that you can
recover your funds even if your computer is damaged. Do not skip this step. You will thank yourself later. Keep it secret. Keep it safe.

## Launching pld

After creating your wallet, you can launch pld with:

    ./bin/pld

Watch the output from the logs and when you see a log line like this:

    1608294386 [INF] headerlogger.go:64 Processed 1 block in the last 24.82s (height 702781, 2020-12-18 13:26:01 +0100 CET)

Compare the height number in the log line (e.g. 702781) to the number in
[the pkt block explorer](https://explorer.pkt.cash) to see when your wallet is up to date. A complete sync from a new installation can take 12+ hours. During this time, the balance in your wallet will not be accurate and you will be unable to transact. You may, however, proceed with creating an address while syncing, as detailed below.

## Creating a New PKT Address

While pld is running in the background (or in another terminal), use the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/address/create
```
or

    ./pldclt wallet/address/create


You should see a series of numbers and letters beginning with `pkt1`. This is your newly created PKT address which you can use for receiving coins. If you need to view it after creation, the address, along with the balance, can be seen in the output from running:
Note: setting *showzerobalance* to true will show all addresses, even those with a zero balance.

```bash
curl -X POST "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "showzerobalance": true }' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/address/balances
```
or

    ./pldctl wallet/address/balances --showzerobalance

do

        ./pldclt wallet/address/balances

in order to see only addresses with a non-zero balance.

In order to view the total balance of your wallet including all the addresses, you can use:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/balance
```

**NOTE**: Every time you use `getnewaddress`, the address you receive must be remembered by pktwallet forever. So, only use it when you actually need an address.

# Using Your Wallet

pldctl is the program that interfaces with a running pktwallet instance. pldctl functions will not work if pktwallet is not running and accessible. Some functions will be limited until pktwallet is fully synchronized. Some functions require the wallet being unlocked before executing.

## Unlocking Wallet

While many functions can be performed while the wallet is locked, other functions first require the wallet to be unlocked, including sending PKT and folding. The passphrase used to unlock the wallet was set when creating the wallet.

To keep your wallet unlocked, use:

    ./pldctl wallet/unlock --wallet_passphrase="pktdi3zkgr" --wallet_name="wallet_xxxxx.db"

*xxxx refers to the wallet name you might have defined upon creation, otherwise the default wallet name is wallet.db and to unlock this --wallet_name is not needed*

## Getting Your Balance

You can check your current PKT balance using pldctl or you can check the balances of each of your addresses if you have more than one.

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/balance

or:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/address/balances

`wallet/address/balances` by itself will not show 0 balance addresses you may have created. To show these addresses, use:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/address/balances --showzerobalance

For more explanation of the meaning of the output of `getaddressbalances`, use:

    ./bin/pldctl help wallet/address/balances

## Sending PKT

You can send PKT using the `sendtoaddress` command, but first you must unlock your wallet for sending, as shown in the previous step.

To send cjd a 10 PKT tip:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=pkt1qt8xe7dwpelngtcpsgn5nkj3pwwdm7gf3l4auax --amount=10 '--from_address=["pkt1xxxxx"]

*pkt1xxxxx = PKT address you want to send from*    

Notice the `'["`. This is because the last argument is actually a quoted
[JSON array](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_arrays.asp). This means you can use multiple
addresses as the source of a payment. For example:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=pkt1xxxxx --amount=10 '--from_address=["pkt1yyyy1","pkt1yyyy2"]

*pkt1xxxx is their address, pkt1yyyy1 and pktyyyy2 is your PKT addresses to send from*

**Windows users require unique formatting for command prompt:**  
>`pldctl.exe wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=<their address> --amount=10 --from_address=[\"<your address>\"]`

### Sweeping an Address

With pktwallet, sending 0 PKT has special significance in that it will send "as much PKT as possible".
To sweep `<old address>` address into `<new address>`, you can use the following command:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=<new address> --amount=0 --from_address='["<old address>"]'

**Windows:**  
>`pldctl.exe wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=<new address> --amount=0 --from_address=[\"<old address>\"]`

**NOTE**: Sweeping an address will send _as much PKT as possible_, which is not necessarily all PKT
in that address. You may need to sweep multiple times before the address is empty.

## Folding Coins

If you are the recipient of many transactions, such as is the case in mining, you may not be able to spend all of them at once. This is similar to someone who is paid in pennies having a difficult time using the pennies to buy a car. To solve this
issue, you can consolidate all of the coins which were paid to you by _folding_.

Folding is sweeping an address _to itself_. Just like in sweeping, you may need to run the command many times before you have completely folded. See FAQs for more detail.

For example:

    ./bin/pldctl wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=<address> --amount=0 --from_address='["<address>"]'

## Opening a lightning channel

First you need to find your node publick key. Do this after unlocking your wallet by running:

    ./bin/pldctl meta/getinfo

get the **identityPubkey** from lightning section. Then you need to convert it by running:

>`echo -n '<identity_pub_key>' | base64 -d | xxd -ps`

You can use the output from this as the node pubkey when opening a channel. To do this, run the command:

    ./bin/pldctl lightning/channel/open --node_pubkey=<node_pubkey> --local_funding_amount=<amount> --private=true

*set private to true if you want your channel to be private*
*amount should be in satoshis*

**Note**: In case your pld instance runs behind NAT make sure you have port-forwarding enable for port 9735, which is the default port for connecting peers.

**Windows:**  
>`pldctl.exe wallet/transaction/sendfrom --to_address=<address> --amount=0 --from_address=[\"<address>\"]`

# FAQs

## I have several machines mining, do I need the wallet running on each machine?

>NO! In fact, the wallet doesn't need to be running at all to mine, but you do need to ensure you have control of the address you are mining to.

## Should I leave pktwallet running?

>It is not a requirement to have pktwallet running to mine. However, if you leave it running, it will stay synced. This will save time when performing pldctl functions, such as folding and sending coins. If pktwallet has not been running for some time, it will need time to sync up to the current block from the time it last ran. As a safety precaution, don't forget to lock your wallet if you do keep it running.

## How often should I fold and why?

>The purpose of folding is to turn all your small payments (such as from mining) into quickly and easily spendable coins. If you are multi-pool mining and have rewards in every block, you will have roughly 1440 unconsolidated transactions per day - one for each block at a rate of ~ 1 block/min. If you do not fold these transactions, after awhile you'll have a huge amount of transactions to process if you wish to send the sum or portion thereof of these smaller transactions. So, while folding isn't required and will have no impact on mining if you do or do not, you're doing yourself a favor later by keeping the transactions as consolidated as possible. It is typical to fold as much as possible every day or every few days when you think about it, depending on your use case. It can also be scripted. Note that folding is a transaction itself. Depending on how much you have to fold, you may need to run the command many times. You also may need to wait for coins to confirm before folding more. Once the folding command fails or you see a very low number in the outputcount field from running `./bin/pldctl wallet/address/balances` or on [PKT block explorer](https://explorer.pkt.cash/) under Unconsolidated Txns, you have successfully folded the best you can for that point in time.
