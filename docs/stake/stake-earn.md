# Stake-to-Earn
Packet introduces an innovative stake-to-earn protocol, designed to reward community members for their long-term commitment to the network. This protocol offers participants the opportunity to lock up their PKT tokens to earn substantial yields and benefit from lucrative yield multipliers. Each 1 PKT is worth 1 Yield Credit. The longer the lockup duration, the higher the multiplier: a 3 month stake yields a 1.5x multiplier, 6 months yields a 2x multiplier, and 12 months yields a 4x multiplier. For instance, staking 1 million PKT for 12 months will result in receiving 4 million yield credits. These yield credits then must be paired with infrastructure in order to earn a daily yield. This structured incentive system is designed to align individual incentives with the broader goal of enhancing the Packet Network's physical infrastructure.
