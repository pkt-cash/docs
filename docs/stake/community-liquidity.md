# Community Liquidity

Locked liquidity within Uniswap's liquidity pools is a cornerstone of the financial health of the Packet Network. The community is incentivized to provide liquidity. By incentivizing PKT holders to stake PKT/ETH into the Uniswap liquidity pool, this stabilizes price, fosters network growth, and makes the market resilient so that large trades do not cause extreme price volatility. Participants benefit from longer-term staking, incentivizing rewards for larger and long-duration investment. This approach enhances the overall ecosystemâ€™s stability, paving the way for increased investor confidence and the long-term success of the network.
