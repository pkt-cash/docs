# Packet Hub

The Packet Hub is a collective of media platforms and content that is available or reachable from the Packet Network. Designed as a place for discovery and global distribution, it features categories across film, TV, music, gaming, casino, technology and beyond.

The Packet Hub enables platform operations, content creators and audiences to converge. Diverse platforms promote and bring their communities to the Packet Hub to simplify their global accessibility. In turn, this creates cross-promotion with other platforms and categories, exposing audiences to new content and platforms. This ecosystem thrives as a collective, enabling content creators to gain access to global distribution, while platforms gain new audiences, and audiences are exposed to new content and brands.

## Platform Awareness

Major ecosystems like iTunes, Google Play and Roku have limited public access - subject to strict restrictions imposed by aggregators. Even once platforms are featured on major ecosystems, they become lost amongst thousands of competitive apps. Packet Hub offers a new open ecosystem where platforms can gain premium visibility and exposure to global audiences. 

Gaining access to the Packet Hub is as easy as claiming a free for life Packet domain, and submitting to be added to the Packet Hub. Platforms can choose to build their platform in the Packet Network, or link from the Packet Hub directly to their current website or app destination in the Web2 world. The Packet Network is accessible globally without geo-fencing. This delivers seamless access to worldwide audiences like never before.

## Building Audience

Often, platforms and content creators focus their marketing and distribution aspirations on traditional major ecosystems. The thinking is that since these incumbent ecosystems have so many users, they must be the best place to conduct business. The problem is itâ€™s very difficult for new platforms and content to even gain access or be featured on these major ecosystems. If access is granted, it is incredibly expensive to gain meaningful public awareness without very large marketing spend investments.

Packet Hub lowers the barrier to entry for media platforms, while also delivering greater visibility and discoverability. As more platforms and content creators frequent the Packet Hub, this creates a new intersection of public awareness and engagement for featured platforms and brands.

## Data Transparency

Platforms that are featured on the Packet Hub are able to transact directly with their audience. There are no platform fees or distribution costs. This enables direct-to-consumer commerce, which reduces distribution and operating costs. In turn, platforms can choose to offer content for lower costs if they choose, creating a preference for their audiences to visit them on the Packet Hub. Platforms and creators also have access to digital payment solutions using blockchain technology, featuring auditable transparency, without middlemen.

## Advertising Model

Optional advertising opportunities will be coming soon to the Packet Hub. Advertising will be widely accessible to brands, platforms and content looking to promote their products. Integrated opportunities will include home-screen carousels, pre-roll and post-roll spots, and banners ads to organically match audiences with the content and products they are interested in discovering.

Traditional media ecosystems do not offer public access to premium advertising positioning, whereas Packet Hub will lower this barrier to entry.
