# Content & Media

Packet Network is designed to address the systemic problems that both audiences and content creators are suffering from. Audiences suffer from both content fatigue and content deficiencies. While major streaming platforms are vying for attention, audiences often struggle to find the content they are looking for, or are required to incur high subscription fees. Content creators across film, TV, gaming, music, also consistently struggle to find reputable distributors who share profits in a fair and transparent way.

For film, TV projects that do find distribution suffer from lack of revenue transparency and systemic distributor failures to provide timely, accurate, royalty statements and payments. 

The incumbent distribution platforms are guarded by gatekeepers that notoriously pay low, or zero acquisition fees, charge extremely distribution fees and inefficiently spend marketing dollars that must be recouped before profit participation begins. Mid-tier platforms lack audiences and big marketing budgets, which limits alternatives.

The Packet Network is paving the way for a new open media network ecosystem called Packet Hub. Here platforms can launch and reach viewers worldwide without geofencing. Audiences are inspired by discovery and cross-pollinated from other content categories on the Packet Hub.

Audiences can also be paid to Stake the infrastructure powers the network. They can choose to cash-out their daily rewards, buy content on the network, or subsidize the costs of their content subscription fees on other platforms.
