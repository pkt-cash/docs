# PKT Documentation
Documentation for the PKT project

### [PKT Network](network/what-is-network)
PKT Network is a fast, resilient, and censorship-resistant media network powered by the people.

Instead of relying on centralized companies for its network infrastructure, PKT is a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) project. This means the network is powered by its global community of economically incentivized users.

### [Staking](stake/stake-earn)
PKT economically incentivizes people to stake and earn PKT. Each stake must be assigned to an infrastructure node that powers the PKT Network. Supporting the network has never been easier. Get started today.

### [Infrastructure](infra/infrastructure)
The PKT Network relies on its community to operate its underlying infrastructure. This is made possible by staking, which requires people to lockup PKT tokens to earn rewards. Beginning in October 26, 2024, each stake must be paired with an infrastructure node to continue receiving rewards. This ensures that the economic incentives in fact scale the underlying network. This ensures providers are rewarded to maintain reliable and accessible network resources.
