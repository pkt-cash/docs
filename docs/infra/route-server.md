# Setup a Route Server Node
The Route Server is used to route traffic on the PKT network.
In order to run a Route Server, you must be running at least:
* 1 Cjdns Node
* 1 VPN Exit
* 1 Domain
* 1 Nameserver

Route Server staking will be coming soon.
At current, the yields which *would* go to Route Servers are evenly divided up by the other stakers.
