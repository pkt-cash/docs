# How to Buy PKT
To buy PKT on Base:

* First you need Ethereum on Base in your web3 wallet. You can buy Ethereum on Base directly in your [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet){:target="_blank"}. Or you can buy from another exchange or crypto on-ramp and transfer to your wallet.

    !!! info "Notice"
        If you have Ethereum, but it is not on the Base network, you can visit [Superbridge](https://bridge.base.org/deposit){:target="_blank"} and bridge your Ethereum from the Ethereum blockchain to the Base blockchain for a small fee (usually less than $3.00)

* If you donâ€™t have a web3 wallet, you can install a Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask wallet here. You can also add the Coinbase and/or MetaMask browswer extension for added convenience.
* Once you have Ethereum on Base, you can swap (aka purchase) PKT with Ethereum directly in your web3 wallet.
