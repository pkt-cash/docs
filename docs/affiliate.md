# Affiliates Rewards
Packet also has an affiliate program built into the protocol. Each connected wallet receives an affiliate code. If an individual (Affiliate-2) stakes using an affiliate code from someone (Affiliate-1), then Affiliate-2 receives a 1% yield bonus, in perpetuity. Affiliate-1, who provided the affiliate code, receives a 4% yield bonus on the stake of Affiliate-2, in perpetuity.

Affiliate-1 also receives a 1% yield bonus, in perpetuity, on the stake of anyone that Affiliate-2 provides their affiliate code to. These rewards incentivize organic growth within the ecosystem, while scaling the network worldwide.
