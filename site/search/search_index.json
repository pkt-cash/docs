Upon declaring candidacy, a proposal should be publicly shared. The proposal should outline the basis and intentions of the Network Steward if elected. Please find suggestions for how to structure a proposal, as the criteria for evaluation is public. Short term impact Short term impact constitutes the project's capability to help the achievement of the PKT project's immediate objectives. For example, a project to search for breakthroughs in wireless technology may be well aligned with PKT's objectives in the long term but will not bear fruit for a significant amount of time. Specific questions useful for evaluating short term impact: Will this project facilitate PKT\u2019s roadmap? Will this project help PKT to distinguish itself from other blockchain projects? Does this project provide a piece of infrastructure which is considered necessary? Long term impact Long term impact constitutes a project's capability to pay dividends to the PKT ecosystem over the long term. Long term impact is important because it fosters a snowball effect of returns on the investment of Network Steward funds. Specific questions useful for evaluating long term impact: Will this project help advance \"infrastructure operator\" roles? Will this project provide key infrastructure/institutions necessary to the emergence of a healthy ecosystem? Does this project bypass a tragedy-of-the-commons problem which blocks the natural emergence of a piece of key infrastructure? Scope and use of resources Use of resources is the question of how \"expensive\" a project is and its ability to fit within the budget. Short and long term impact will be evaluated with attention to the impact/cost ratio. Note that volunteer time/effort spent by the Network Steward, or their team in order to oversee the project will be taken into account, so all other things being equal, a few large projects are preferable to a large number of smaller ones. Some questions which may be useful for evaluating scope and use of resources include: Do the metrics for success justify the amount of effort placed on the project? Does the cost for effort seem to be a good deal (attention shall be given to the skill sets of declared participants)? Are there competitive aspects with the project to promote efficient use of resources? Risk control Risk control is about the question of how likely a project is to fail at delivering the expected result. Projects which are inherently more risky will be evaluated more stringently on their proposed risk control. Specific questions useful to the evaluation of risk control include: How evenly is the effort spaced over the milestones of the project? How evenly is the payment spaced over the milestones of the project? How well did the candidate specify success criteria for the project? To what extent are the risks defined and planned for in the project proposal? To what extent are the difficulties and potential blockers moved to the early parts of the project? What evidence is there that the Network Steward is capable of delivering? Hazard control The objective of the Network Steward is for the community to elect someone who will build or oversee projects that benefit the entire PKT ecosystem equally without unfairly benefitting any one participant over any other. Hazard control is about preventing any incentive or the perception of an incentive which would promote a corruption of the process from its objective. Public perceptions are almost as important as the real thing because the perception of hazard discourages new participants from joining the PKT ecosystem and encourages existing participants to submit projects which are at least as corrupt as they imagine the average project to be. Some questions which may be useful to the evaluation of hazard control include: To what extent is the project safe from any real or perceived conflicts of interest? To what extent are the results of this project equally advantageous to all participants in the PKT ecosystem? To what extent does the proposal structure the project such that success will be more advantageous to the applicant than failure? The use of milestones, deliverables and evenly spaced payments conditioned on deliveries is encouraged. To what extent does the project control the risk of arbitrage profit opportunity for the applicant? An example of arbitrage profit opportunity appears when there is a lack of market agreement on the cost of the deliverables which the project will produce. Logo design is a good example of a deliverable for which there lacks market agreement on the cost. While PepeiCo saw fit to spend one million dollars on their logo, the Nike logo was bought for a mere $35. In the case of such an expenditure, the overall community may be unable to verify whether a project constitutes a million dollars worth of diligent effort or a $35 drawing sold at a markup. Did the applicant declare and control for any potential conflicts of interest? Potentially unacceptable projects Some projects may be judged by the community to be unacceptable under any conditions. An intuitive example would be a proposal to build an assassination market which is blatantly illegal and contrary to the objectives of the project. These judgements will be made by individual voters. Some questions which are useful in the evaluation of acceptability: Does the project seem more likely to benefit the PKT ecosystem than to harm it? Does the project seem unlikely to cause significant damage to the perceived legitimacy of the PKT ecosystem? Delayed milestones While it is not in the interest of the community to rush projects, it is important to guard against the possibility of candidates applying for projects and then not doing the work - planning to abandon the project unless there is a precipitous increase in the price at which they can sell PKT.","title":"Network Steward Charter"},{"location":"governance-nsc/#network-steward-charter","text":"Anyone considering becoming Network Steward will need to publicly declare themselves to be a candidate.

However unlike the vote in legacy PKT, coins will need to be locked up in order to vote. There will be no specific lockup period required, and there will be no vote multiplier for using a longer lockup period, but each PKT, and each 1 PKT worth of locked up LP Token, will be worth one vote. The same voting mechanism will allow changes to both the Network Steward and the Executor. However, changing the Executor is a more solemn matter and so will only occur when 75% of all actively voting coins continually approve such change for 4 consecutive weeks. This 75% rule is borrowed from the requirement for approving changes to the US Constitution. The allocation of yields is however a more complex affair, and just as the mining pools had centrally decided the allocation of yields, the application of the rules laid out in the Infrastructure section will be managed by a centralized \u201cExecutor\u201d. How Does Electorium Work? Nobody ever sits down and asks themselves who is most fit to manage the affairs of the nation. Instead people argue over whether it\u2019s going to be the blue guy or the red guy, and they think that\u2019s democracy. It\u2019s quite possible that the entire partisan landscape as we know it is an artifact of a flawed voting system. The dream of the third party candidate is that if enough people would vote for him, he would no longer be \u201cthird party\u201d. But to get there, he needs to somehow overcome the objection that voting for him means losing a chance to vote against \"The Bad Guy\". Even the third party candidate does not ask the voter who is most fit to rule! If we could just cast all the politics and partisanship aside and get to the real heart of the question, everybody\u2019s answer would probably be different. We\u2019d most likely have a beautiful patchwork of nominations including businessmen, professors, soldiers, clergy, and other people of distinction. To address this, PKT uses a new vote counting algorithm called Electorium. It is in essence a search algorithm. It finds the candidate who cannot be beaten by anyone else, if we were to pretend that neither they, nor their challenger, voted for each other. So in the case of Alice and Bob, we pretend Alice is not voting for Bob, and Bob is not voting for Alice and we can easily find the winner. This computation of delegated votes is not as simple as it might seem. If Alice votes for Bob, and Bob votes for Alice, it is not immediately obvious who should win. Not only that, it is important that the counting process be fast. There is also another case where perhaps Alice votes for Bob, but Bob does not vote for Alice. It might seem that Bob is the clear winner, but if the majority of his votes have been received from or through Alice, then by these rules Alice still wins. However, if there is another candidate who receives more votes than Alice but less than Bob, Bob becomes the winner because Alice loses and is forced to delegate her votes. Delegated Voting Using Electorium you can vote for anyone, but no one is required to be a candidate. If you vote for someone who does not wish to be a candidate, your vote is simply delegated to whoever they vote for. Everyone who chooses to be a candidate automatically votes for themselves. If they vote for someone else, that vote is secondary to their implied vote for themselves. To put it differently, voting as a candidate will never cause you to lose. If a candidate explicitly votes for himself, his explicit vote is meaningless. It is the same as indicating his candidacy without voting at all. This voting system values each vote by the amount of PKT the voter holds. This is of course unlike a standard national election where every citizen gets an equal vote. But like almost all blockchains, PKT has nothing analogous to the concept of the citizen. One person can trivially pretend to be thousands, or even millions, of unique individuals. So PKT must by necessity adopt the model used in public corporations, where votes are weighted based on how much of the coin is held. This idea of weighting the vote based on skin in the game actually makes some sense as well. In a national election, every citizen could be considered to have the equal skin in the game, it is their life and family that is at stake. But in the case of a project or online community, a person with little investment can easily walk away, so they cannot be expected to make decisions with the same level of care as someone whose involvement is greater. Thus voting is done as proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake voting is done publicly. The right to vote one\u2019s conscience without fear of repercussion is a fundamental part of the modern democratic process. But anonymous voting on a blockchain is largely uncharted territory, so it is not clear how, or even if, this could be achieved. In any case, there is one advantage to public voting, and that is public voting of the delegates. When you choose who is to represent you, you certainly should know what decisions they make. You might wonder what happens if you want to vote for somebody, but you don\u2019t like who they would vote for. Well you can\u2019t have it both ways, either you trust their judgment or you don\u2019t, and the beauty of this system is that it forces you to reconcile that. You also don\u2019t get to evade moral responsibility by choosing a lovable candidate who's guaranteed to lose. The question before you is who is most fit to lead, and you cannot vote without answering it. If you do vote, it is highly likely that your vote will somehow help elect the final winner. Secret voting, while important for the general public, is abhorrent when done in the senate chamber. In the Electorium system everyone is a potential senator, and everyone\u2019s vote is a matter of public record. You only need to vote once, and your vote counts in every election with whatever balance you have at the time of the election, until you either change it, or it expires.

However unlike the vote in legacy PKT, coins will need to be locked up in order to vote. There will be no specific lockup period required, and there will be no vote multiplier for using a longer lockup period, but each PKT, and each 1 PKT worth of locked up LP Token, will be worth one vote. The same voting mechanism will allow changes to both the Network Steward and the Executor. However, changing the Executor is a more solemn matter and so will only occur when 75% of all actively voting coins continually approve such change for 4 consecutive weeks. This 75% rule is borrowed from the requirement for approving changes to the US Constitution. The allocation of yields is however a more complex affair, and just as the mining pools had centrally decided the allocation of yields, the application of the rules laid out in the Infrastructure section will be managed by a centralized \u201cExecutor\u201d.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"governance/#how-does-electorium-work","text":"Nobody ever sits down and asks themselves who is most fit to manage the affairs of the nation. Instead people argue over whether it\u2019s going to be the blue guy or the red guy, and they think that\u2019s democracy. It\u2019s quite possible that the entire partisan landscape as we know it is an artifact of a flawed voting system. The dream of the third party candidate is that if enough people would vote for him, he would no longer be \u201cthird party\u201d. But to get there, he needs to somehow overcome the objection that voting for him means losing a chance to vote against \"The Bad Guy\". Even the third party candidate does not ask the voter who is most fit to rule! If we could just cast all the politics and partisanship aside and get to the real heart of the question, everybody\u2019s answer would probably be different. We\u2019d most likely have a beautiful patchwork of nominations including businessmen, professors, soldiers, clergy, and other people of distinction. To address this, PKT uses a new vote counting algorithm called Electorium. It is in essence a search algorithm. It finds the candidate who cannot be beaten by anyone else, if we were to pretend that neither they, nor their challenger, voted for each other. So in the case of Alice and Bob, we pretend Alice is not voting for Bob, and Bob is not voting for Alice and we can easily find the winner. This computation of delegated votes is not as simple as it might seem. If Alice votes for Bob, and Bob votes for Alice, it is not immediately obvious who should win. Not only that, it is important that the counting process be fast. There is also another case where perhaps Alice votes for Bob, but Bob does not vote for Alice. It might seem that Bob is the clear winner, but if the majority of his votes have been received from or through Alice, then by these rules Alice still wins. However, if there is another candidate who receives more votes than Alice but less than Bob, Bob becomes the winner because Alice loses and is forced to delegate her votes.","title":"How Does Electorium Work?"},{"location":"governance/#delegated-voting","text":"Using Electorium you can vote for anyone, but no one is required to be a candidate. If you vote for someone who does not wish to be a candidate, your vote is simply delegated to whoever they vote for. Everyone who chooses to be a candidate automatically votes for themselves. If they vote for someone else, that vote is secondary to their implied vote for themselves. To put it differently, voting as a candidate will never cause you to lose. If a candidate explicitly votes for himself, his explicit vote is meaningless. It is the same as indicating his candidacy without voting at all. This voting system values each vote by the amount of PKT the voter holds. This is of course unlike a standard national election where every citizen gets an equal vote. But like almost all blockchains, PKT has nothing analogous to the concept of the citizen. One person can trivially pretend to be thousands, or even millions, of unique individuals. So PKT must by necessity adopt the model used in public corporations, where votes are weighted based on how much of the coin is held. This idea of weighting the vote based on skin in the game actually makes some sense as well. In a national election, every citizen could be considered to have the equal skin in the game, it is their life and family that is at stake. But in the case of a project or online community, a person with little investment can easily walk away, so they cannot be expected to make decisions with the same level of care as someone whose involvement is greater. Thus voting is done as proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake voting is done publicly. The right to vote one\u2019s conscience without fear of repercussion is a fundamental part of the modern democratic process. But anonymous voting on a blockchain is largely uncharted territory, so it is not clear how, or even if, this could be achieved. In any case, there is one advantage to public voting, and that is public voting of the delegates. When you choose who is to represent you, you certainly should know what decisions they make. You might wonder what happens if you want to vote for somebody, but you don\u2019t like who they would vote for. Well you can\u2019t have it both ways, either you trust their judgment or you don\u2019t, and the beauty of this system is that it forces you to reconcile that. You also don\u2019t get to evade moral responsibility by choosing a lovable candidate who's guaranteed to lose. The question before you is who is most fit to lead, and you cannot vote without answering it. If you do vote, it is highly likely that your vote will somehow help elect the final winner. Secret voting, while important for the general public, is abhorrent when done in the senate chamber. In the Electorium system everyone is a potential senator, and everyone\u2019s vote is a matter of public record. You only need to vote once, and your vote counts in every election with whatever balance you have at the time of the election, until you either change it, or it expires. There is a vote expiration time of 1 year so that lost wallets will not affect the outcome of elections forever.","title":"Delegated Voting"},{"location":"governance/#executor","text":"From launch day, the Executor will be hard coded.

It is recognized that for PKT to accomplish its goals, there must be a community who understands and uses the technology. In this way communication cannot be avoided. However, poor communication, even made with the best intentions, risks harming the reputation of the project and the general public. So these guidelines exist to help community members represent the project in the best way possible. A Far Higher Standard Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are a significant number of outright criminal activities. Beyond those, there is a wide gray area of communication activities which have not been subject to any regulatory enforcement, but still fall far outside of what these guidelines established as ethical. Community members are cautioned that due to the scale of these \"gray\" activities, there is a large body of publications, influencers, marketers, \"shills\" and other professionals who, if consulted or emulated, are highly likely to put a person in ethical peril. The reason is because these guidelines establish a far higher standard of communication ethics than that which is generally considered to be legal. Principle of No Expected Return It is acknowledged that buying and selling are central aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, so it is difficult to effectively communicate about the project without ever addressing reasons why a person might do these things. Therefore these guidelines offer a pre-approved narrative which is considered to be maximally protective of the reputation of the project while also providing a healthy perspective regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrency. The Principle of No Expected Return is that one should buy cryptocurrency if and only if they believe strongly enough in the vision of the project that they would be proud to own the coin even if they were never able to sell it. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was widely believed that it would be legislated out of existence or otherwise collapse, and so this principle was pervasive throughout the community. Many people chose to hold Bitcoin as a political statement regarding the morality of modern financial institutions, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. The key components of the Principle of No Expected Return are: * A clear understanding of what the technology is and what it is not. * A belief in the social change which that technology can realistically facilitate. * The mental and financial preparedness to lose any money or effort that is used to acquire the token, as one has when one makes a donation. When you\u2019re considering buying a token, you need to ask yourself: If you were to lose everything you put into a token, would you look back on the day you bought it, proud to have been a part of the project at that time? If the answer is no, then you\u2019re either planning to buy too much, or you\u2019re just not ready. Guidelines Dishonest, intentionally misleading, or otherwise unlawful communication is obviously unethical. Beyond that there is no clear definition for unethical communication, though one could characterize it in the words of Justice Stewart, \"I know it when I see it\". These non-exhaustive guidelines exist to give community members an understanding of the types of communication which are most likely to be unethical. They are listed in order of importance with the most important first. Communications which follow the letter, but not the spirit, of these guidelines are unethical. One example of this is token disclaimers such as \"this is not financial advice\". Disclaimers can be useful for helping a person understand the limitations and caveats of a communication, but a token disclaimer exists more to make the communicator seem innocent than to help the audience have a clearer understanding. The use of fine print, or disclaimers which \"feel out of place\" in the overall communication should be regarded as red flags, and communicators using these should review the objectives of their message and whether it is being communicated clearly. Communications which a person of sound judgment could plausibly interpret as presenting a low risk low effort opportunity to make money , or \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, are unethical. Presenting an opportunity can take many forms including implication though specific selection of facts, or an over-celebratory tone. Generally speaking, communications should be explicit about their objective so that there is minimal chance of mis-interpretation. Communications in which a person suffering impaired judgment has an unusually high likelihood of interpreting as a low risk low effort opportunity to make money are unethical. Topics like \u201cwinning\u201d, \u201cpump\u201d, \u201cFOMO\u201d, \u201cYOLO\u201d (spend all of your money), \u201cmoon\u201d, and the idea of being rich, may strike the average person as nothing more than a bit of low-culture humor, but for a pathological gambler these can trigger a harmful thought process and should be avoided. Communications related to investment and trading of the token should be addressed to investors and traders \u2014 professionals who know how hard it is to reliably beat the market and who make decisions based on their own unique portfolio and risk management strategy. Any kind of communication around these topics which has a celebratory tone, or which could reasonably be interpreted as investment advice is not ethical. Communications which focus entirely on explaining a piece of technology, without any mention or implication of buying, selling, price, or potential future growth (including growth in usage of the technology), are probably ethical. Communications which address the topic of buying, selling or staking, but are specifically focused on the Principle of No Expected Return, are probably ethical.","title":"Ethical Communication Guidelines"},{"location":"community/ethica-communication-guidelines/#ethical-communication-guidelines","text":"This is a guideline for ethical communications about the project.

AnodeVPN server IKEv2 Ipsec VPN server OpenVPN server SNI proxy Requirements A server running debian based Linux (preferably Ubuntu 22.04) Install docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ * Install jq sudo apt-get install jq Steps Create a data directory where the server configuration will be stored. console mkdir vpn_data Configure the server by running the following command: console docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/vpn_data:/data pkteer/pkt-server /configure.sh Configure various service by running the following command: console ./vpn_data/setup.sh The script will prompt you to set up various flags and values needed for setting up the services the first time. Run the server by running the following commands: console ./vpn_data/start-vpn.sh NOTE It can take a few minutes on the first run for the server to set up all the services. Monitoring the server You can view the progress of the server by running: docker logs -f pkt-server You can also check the status of all services by running: ./vpn_data/status.sh or using the AnodeVPN API: http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/status/ Understanding the process Configuration The configure.sh script is designed to set up and configure the server environment. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionality: Initialization and Default Values: The script initializes several flags and variables with default values: no_vpn_flag : Indicates whether VPN should be disabled (default: false). cjdns_flag : Indicates whether CJDNS should be enabled (default: true). with_pktd_flag : Indicates whether PKTD should be enabled (default: false). pktd_passwd : Stores the PKTD password (default: empty). pktd_user : Stores the PKTD username (default: \"x\"). Configuration File Handling: The script checks if the configuration file /data/config.json exists. If it does, it reads the existing configuration; otherwise, it copies a template configuration from /server/config.json to /data/config .json. Configuration Synchronization: If the configuration file exists, the script ensures that all fields from the template configuration are present in the existing configuration. Missing fields are added with their default values from the template. Flag Parsing: The script parses command-line arguments to set various flags: --no-vpn : Disables VPN. --with-pktd : Enables PKTD. --pktd-passwd= : Sets the PKTD password. Configuration Modification: Based on the parsed flags, the script modifies the configuration: Sets the VPN exit status based on no_vpn_flag . Enables or disables PKTD based on with_pktd_flag . Generates a random PKTD password if none is provided. Updates the PKTD username and password in the configuration. PKT Wallet Initialization: Starts the PKT Wallet daemon and checks if a wallet already exists. If not, it creates a new wallet and unlocks it. VPN Server Configuration: Retrieves the PKT Wallet secret for the VPN server and ensures the cjdroute.conf configuration file is valid. If the file does not exist, it generates a new one and seeds it with the retrieved secret. Security Configuration: Modifies the cjdroute.conf file to set specific security parameters. Script Deployment: Finally it copies several utility scripts from the server directory to the data directory for further use. Initialization The init.sh starts everytime the docker container is launched and is responsible for setting up and initializing various services and configurations on the server. Server Configuration Check : It first checks if the server has already been configured by looking if cjdroute.conf exists. If the file is not found, the script exits. User Creation : It creates two users, cjdns and speedtest. They are used for running the cjdns and speed-test (iperf3) services, respectively. Configuration Updates : It reads the config.json configuration file and updates several configuration settings related to different services. PKT Wallet Initialization : It starts the PKT Wallet service and checks if a wallet already exists. If the wallet exists, it attempts to unlock it. If the unlock request times out, it restarts the wallet service. Cjdns Service : If cjdns is enabled, it sets up the necessary environment and starts the cjdns service. It also configures network settings and firewall rules to allow cjdns to function properly. PKTD Service : If PKTD is enabled, it constructs and runs the command to start the PKTD service with the appropriate configuration. Network Interface Check : It waits for tun0 network interface that is expected to be created by cjdroute to become available and then sets up firewall rules for network traffic. NFTables Initialization : It initializes NFTables, which is a framework for packet filtering and network address translation. VPN Server : If the VPN server is enabled, it starts the VPN server and sets up the pricing for the VPN service. Speed Test Service : It sets up the environment for running speed tests and starts the necessary services. Cjdns Peers : It adds peers for the cjdns network, the peers used are set in /server/cjdnspeers.json file. IKEv2 and OpenVPN : If IKEv2 or OpenVPN are enabled, it runs the respective configuration scripts to set up these VPN services. Node Exporter : It starts the Node Exporter service for Prometheus monitoring. SNI Proxy : If SNI Proxy is enabled, it starts the SNI Proxy service. Cron Job for Payments : It adds a cron job to handle payments on a weekly basis. Watchdog Service : If cjdns is enabled, it starts a watchdog service to monitor and maintain the cjdns service the AnodeVPN server and other services depending on the configuration of the server. Keep-Alive : Finally, it keeps the container running indefinitely by tailing /dev/null . Monitoring with watchdog The watchdog.sh is monitoring the cjdroute service and if it stops it will restart it, when the cjdroute is restarted the AnodeVPN server is also restarted. It will also check for the pluto service which is the IKEv2 Ipsec VPN server and if it stops it will restart it. Similarly for the openvpn service. Finally the watchdog also checks the validity of vpnclients created by the AnodeVPN server and if their time has expired it will remove them. Checking the status You can check the status of the services at any time either by running ```console vpn_data/status.sh ``` or by using the AnodeVPN API: ```console http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/status/ ``` Next to each service you will see the process id if that service is running, otherwise it will be 0 . e.g. { \"hostname\": \"kraut2.pkteer.com\", \"pktwallet\": 67, \"cjdns\": 82, \"anodeserver\": 114, \"ikev2\": 4012, \"openvpn\": 4135, \"watchdog\": 4116, \"date_time\": \"2024-07-17 10:08:19\" } Understanding the services and files Launching the server The vpn_data/start-vpn.sh and vpn_data/start.sh scripts are designed to set up and run a VPN server using Docker. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the script does: Environment Setup : It checks for the presence of necessary commands (jq, dirname, and docker). If any of these commands are missing, the script exits with an error message. Directory Navigation : It changes the working directory to the location of the script. Cjdns Port Extraction : It reads the cjdroute.conf file to extract the port number used by the cjdjns service. If the port number is not found in the expected format, it attempts to extract it using an alternative method. Configuration Reading : It reads the config.json file to get the region and city information. If either the region or city is not specified, the script exits with an error message. Cjdns RPC Port Setup : If the cjdns RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is enabled, it extracts the RPC port from the cjdroute.conf file and updates the configuration to expose the RPC port. Docker Container Execution : It runs a Docker container with various configurations: Sets the timezone based on the region and city defined in vpn_data/config.json . Configures logging, network capabilities, and device access. Sets system control parameters for IPv6 and IPv4 forwarding. Maps several ports for different services: reads the CJDNS port from the cjdroute.conf file and maps it to the host. 5201 port for the speed-test (iperf3) service. 64764 to the host for pktd service. 443 for the SNI Proxy service. 80 for the SNI Proxy service. 500 for the IKEv2 Ipsec VPN server (pluto service). 4500 for the IKEv2 Ipsec VPN server (pluto service). 943 for the OpenVPN server. 1194 for the OpenVPN server. Mounts necessary directories for data persistency and configuration files. /etc/openvpn to vpn_data/openvpn. /server/vpnclients to vpn_data/vpnclients. /data to vpn_data where the configuration files are stored, cjdroute.conf and config.json and others. Optionally maps the CJDNS RPC port if it is enabled. Runs the container in detached mode with elevated privileges. The script ensures that all necessary configurations are in place and starts the VPN server within a Docker container, making it ready for use. Cjdns Cjdns is running on the server using a generated cjdroute.conf file. The cjdroute.conf file is generated by the configure script It is being launched by the init script which is run on the server start. For persistency the file is stored in the vpn_data directory and used by the cjdns service. You can manually edit the file to add more cjdns peers. Note Changing other parts of the configuration manually may end up breaking the service. Wathdog is configured to keep cjdns running all the time. If the service stops, the watchdog will restart it. If cjdroute is for some reason stuck or frozen you can kill it by running docker exec -it pkt-server killall cjdroute and the watchdog will restart it. AnodeVPN Server The server is running the AnodeVPN server to authorize clients and offer API access to the VPN services such as: Add domain to SNI proxy http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/domain/add/ console json { \"domain\": \"example.com\", \"cjdnsIpv6\": \"fc00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\" } Remove domain from SNI proxy http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/domain/remove/ console json { \"domain\": \"example.com\", \"cjdnsIpv6\": \"fc00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\" } Request new PKT address http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/premium/address/ console json {} Request new client VPN certificates http://[server]:8099/api/0.4/server/vpnaccess/ console json { \"address\": \"pkt1....\" } For more details see the AnodeVPN IKEv2 Ipsec VPN Server The IKEv2 Ipsec VPN server is running on the server and is used to provide VPN services to clients with access to cjdns network. For setting up the server the init script will launch the vpn_configure.sh if the ikev2:enabled flag is set to true, which will set up the server. We also use the ikev2.sh script to add/remove clients through the AnodeVPN API. The files generated are copied in server/vpnclients directory which is mapped to vpn_data/vpnclients/ on the docker host. For more details look into the setup-ipsec-vpn documentation for configuring the server, managing clients and troubleshooting. NOTE Unfortunately although IKEv2 clients can connect to the server from a Windows client and get VPN access, the clients are not able to access the CJDNS network. This is a known issue and we are working on a solution, for this reason we have added the OpenVPN server as an alternative for Windows users. OpenVPN Server The openvpn is initialized by the init script if the openvpn.enabled flag is set to true in config.json and is used to provide VPN services to clients with access to cjdns network. The server is configured using the openvpn_configure.sh which is used to generate the certificates needed. Then for adding new clients the createOpenVpnClient.sh script is used by the AnodeVPN Server API to generate the client certificates and keys. The files are stored in the vpn_data/vpnclients/ directory and can be used to connect to the server. NOTE The OpenVPN server is running on the server and is used to provide VPN services to clients with access to cjdns network. This was added on top of the IKEv2 for Windows users to be able to access the cjdns network, but it can be used by any OpenVPN client on any platform. SNI Proxy Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname contained in the initial request of the TCP session. This enables websites that are hosted on CJDNS network to become available via HTTPS name-based virtual hosting. The SNI proxy will start if the sniproxy.enabled flag is set to true in the config.json file. The sniproxy is using the sniproxy.conf file to route the requests to the correct server. The server contains the default configuration for the sniproxy and is being edited by the adddomain.sh and removedomain.sh scripts which are used by the AnodeVPN API to add and remove domains respectively from the proxy. For troubleshooting you can view the sniproxy logs. The access log is stored in vpn_data/sniproxy-access.log and the error log is stored in vpn_data/sniproxy-error.log .","title":"Setup a VPN Exit Node"},{"location":"infra/exit-node/#setup-a-vpn-exit-node","text":"This guide will help you set up a CJDNS node with PKT wallet and the following services: You can follow the steps to set up the server or read more about the process and services involved.

This offers participants significant daily PKT rewards for staking PKT. Coming October 30, 2024 is Infrastructure Day, when users will be required to pair each stake with an infrastructure node to continue earning staking rewards. There are 5 different node types, ranging in operational complexity, with different infrastructure requirements and yields. Instead of mining, PKT holders can stake their tokens and pair with infrastructure nodes to earn yields. To incentivize operators to make long term commitments to run infrastructure for the network, there are yield bonus multipliers based on staking duration. Infrastructure Yields Starting on Infrastructure Day, October 30, 2024, each stake will be required to pair with at least one PKT Network infrastructure node in order to continue earning yields. Operators will be able to assign yield credits to each PKT infrastructure node. Instead of all yield credits competing for one bucket of yields, there will be one bucket for each of the 5 types of infrastructure in the PKT network. One lockup can assign yield credits to multiple units of infrastructure, but one unit of infrastructure can only be assigned yield credits from one lockup. Cjdns Nodes 40% of all yields will go to cjdns nodes which have an open port and public peering credentials, so anyone can connect. Operators can assign up to $5,000 worth of yield credits per cjdns node, with each yield credit being valued at 1 PKT Yields will still be allocated based on yield credits, so if the PKT price goes up, older cjdns nodes will be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in and be able to hold more yield credits than newer ones, and thus yield better. If the PKT price goes down, node operators will be able to increase their assigned yield credits if they so choose. Every cjdns node will be tested each week, and if the node is found to be in a non-functional state, the node will lose yields for that week. If a node fails 4 weeks in a row, it will be removed from the roster and when it comes back online it will be capped at $5,000 worth of yield credits based on the value at the time it comes back. In order to incentivize geographical distribution of nodes, cjdns nodes will get a bonus if they are on IP address blocks, or ISPs that have few other cjdns nodes, as follows: Effective yield credits are equal to real assigned yield credits TIMES: One over (\u201cdivided by\u201d) the number of cjdns nodes running on your IPv4 address, plus Note Running multiple cjdns nodes on the same device is not efficient . One over the number of cjdns nodes running in your IPv4 address block, plus Note What is an IP address block?

Audiences can get paid to support the network and can use their network rewards to cash-out or pay for content. Building Audience Participants install a basic app and are paid to contribute small amounts of internet bandwidth to power the network. The income earned is paid in a digital currency called PKT, which audiences can then use to pay for content. This attracts global audiences interested in passive income and offsets the overhead costs of operating the platform. Premium Curation BIA uses AI technology and an A-list peer review system to curate premium content on the platform. Creators submit their product to renowned talent (producers, talent, etc) who can become revenue-share Premium Executive Producers. AI also identifies trending, up-voted products. This ensures the premium content on the platform. Data Transparency Creators upload their content to the platform using a digital rights management (DRM) dashboard. This enables creators to program a smart contract to automatically pay royalties. When content is purchased, payouts are distributed in real-time to guilds, investors and net profit participants using blockchain technology, with auditable transparency, but without middlemen. Worldwide Accessibility The PKT Network is accessible globally without geo-fencing. This delivers seamless access to worldwide audiences like never before. Using BIA, audiences make money by powering the network. They can cash-out, or use their income to pay for content.

These RWA\u2019s will represent access rights to bandwidth over a period of time and serve as a unique way to quantify and monetize the value of the PKT node operators' resources. These RWA\u2019s should then be exchangeable in a decentralized bandwidth trading marketplace, or even sellable to internet service providers (ISPs) looking to expand their network capacity. The challenge in creating a marketplace for bandwidth-backed RWAs is that bandwidth quality varies significantly depending on network infrastructure, the node operator\u2019s location, and demand. These factors all make it difficult to accurately price these assets and ensure fair market dynamics. PKT is partnered with Allora AI to provide price predictions. This enables analysis of vast amounts of data to create highly accurate AI-generated prices to establish a reliable source of truth for bandwidth pricing. The result is for enabling PKT\u2019s bandwidth marketplace to function more efficiently and transparently. By integrating with Allora\u2019s plug-and-play AI price predictions and self-improving machine intelligence network, the PKT project can operate at the forefront of AI development tools and computational resources. Allora is a network that enables different ML models to simultaneously evaluate and learn from other models on the network to collaboratively optimize shared ML objectives (for example, accurately assessing the price of an RWA). The network uses the results from these models to create an aggregated meta-inference which consistently outperforms any individual model on the network, thus creating a source of highly-performant collective intelligence. Over the last 3 years, models built by the Allora Labs team (formerly known as Upshot) have effectively produced price predictions for more than 400 million assets with a 95-99% confidence for the most accurate predictions. As such, this collaboration blends Allora\u2019s powerful AI price predictions with the development of PKT\u2019s bandwidth-backed RWAs and decentralized markets, to create AI powered, bandwidth trading marketplaces. Allora price prediction models will predict the fair value of bandwidth-backed RWAs based on various factors such as network quality, location, and demand. PKT node operators will be able to tokenize their bandwidth-backed RWAs into the marketplace, with prices calibrated using Allora's AI predictions.
